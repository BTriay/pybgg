						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

After three rounds, players must figure out the case. I had fun with this one and want to play it again. More of a puzzle/activity than a game." />

									<comment username="Oasis" rating="7" value="A game or an activity? Either way Witness an enjoyable time. Witness is an exactly 4 player game, no more, no less. The players are trying to figure out a mystery and collective attempt to gain the most accuracy points. Each player is given a clue in which they must share it with there neighbor, then the neighbor shares there clue plus yours with his neighbor. At the end can you recall all the information you gathered and deduct the answers to the mystery. With over 60 mysteries, it will be some time before the game is &quot;completed.&quot; " />

									<comment username="chaddyboy_2000" rating="7" value="A really clever game where players read the background of a case together, and then read a page of their own personal book to see what evidence the know about the case.

In an order that the game dictates, players then share information with each other, gradually learning more and more about the case.  You may not take notes during this time, so it ends up being quite a bit of a memory exercise.

Once several rounds of sharing have been completed, players are then allowed to jot down notes, and three questions about the case are posed.  Some times, the questions are straight up regurgitation of information you&#039;ve learned, and others you might have to apply some logic or puzzle solving to answer the questions.  Each player answers the questions themselves, scoring 1 point for each correct question.  Add up all of the scores to see how the entire team scored.

Overall, really well done.  I normally hate both memory and deduction, but there really wasn&#039;t much in the way of deduction in the cases we did (some may have more than others, but you can&#039;t really browse the cases without spoiling them, so I don&#039;t really know).  The memory ranged from tedious (remembering peoples&#039; names) to more fun for me (remembering how to draw a picture or something with more details).  I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it!" />
