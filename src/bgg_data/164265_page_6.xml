						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

									<comment username="srand" rating="8" value="Extremely clever game based on Chinese Whispers/Telephone for exactly 4 players. There are 64 cases, each of which includes a mission briefing, one piece of information for each player, and three questions to be asked at the end. Players pass their information to each other in specified interactions, e.g. player 1 listening first to the information from the player to their left, then passing both bits of information to the one on their right, then going back to the left for more. Each player listens to one other and speaks to one other, so some information is heard third-hand.

I&#039;ve played 6 of the cases at various different difficulty levels and the quality varies. Generally (but not always) they require memorizing the components of a logic puzzle, e.g. one includes five Yakuza each with a different occupation and a different missing finger; the better ones disguise this with other puzzles.

What&#039;s hard and occasionally frustrating is that a single weak link can break the puzzle for everyone - a missing word, transposed symbols and so on. In theory there&#039;s a scoring system where each player independently answers the questions and the score out of 12 determines how well the team has done, but our experience has been that errors are more likely to occur in the communication than the solving, which can leave no-one with correct answers.

Just delightful." />

									<comment username="shadow_bind" rating="8" value="A terribly inefficient method of solving crimes, but a fantastic cerebral filler when you have exactly four people. Witness is at its peak when the cases contain potential red herrings or peculiar details which keep teams on their toes. Nothing beats having the rug pulled from under your collective feet when your team realises that a weird smudge in the clues was crucial to the case all along. 

However, a number of cases are straightforward and revolve around memorising a series of logical statements. It’s quite disappointing to encounter this sort of cases in the upper levels because they just require increasingly elaborate mnemonics. Also, the English translation contains a few vaguely-worded clues and typos which will affect the outcome of a case. (In particular, look out for cases #53 and #54.)

Uneven case qualities aside, this is a very unique title for the collection. Obviously the memory and simple puzzle-solving elements will not go down well with many, but I&#039;ve been fortunate so far to have had several accomplices (willing or otherwise) to help me complete a quarter of the cases." />

									<comment username="Nillo" rating="8" value="This is a really unique and cool game about solving crimes as a team of 4. Note that you need to be exactly 4 players to play this.

The way it works is that people whisper clues to each other and then try to solve the crime using all the clues they heard from other players. This is made more difficult because of the fact that some of the clues have passed through several player&#039;s ears before they get to you, it&#039;s like a game of telephone.

This game has a limited playtime because each case can only be played once. If any of the players have played the case before it kinda ruins the mechanics. It&#039;s important that nobody has seen the solution to the puzzle before." />
