						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

									<comment username="realityfoible" rating="7" value="This clever little game combines a bit of Sherlock Holmes and a bit of Telephone into a silly fifteen minutes of bafflement. 
Each player gets a small clue to an overall puzzle, and must whisper it in their neighbor&#039;s ear.  This happens four times, by which point - hypothetically - each player will have heard a complete report of everyone&#039;s combined information.
However this will never be the case as inevitably crucial details will be forgotten or misinterpreted, and each player&#039;s answer to the overall mystery will be hilariously absurd. " />

									<comment username="BaBang" rating="7" value="A wonderful cooperative deduction game where players play a game of telephone in order to answer the questions to a particular case. Problem is, each player has a different part of the puzzle and no one knows what the questions are until the end of the information-exchange. Thus, there is potential for players to mischaracterize and misconstrue the importance of the evidence. 

That being said, this is one of those &quot;consumable games.&quot; Once you have played a puzzle, there is little-to-no replayability factor, unless you have a very bad memory. But with 64 cases, you certainly get your money&#039;s worth. 

Hopefully additional cases will be published in the future. " />

									<comment username="lordvoldemort" rating="7" value="A four player only game whose primary mechanism is Telephone.  You get a clue that you must whisper to a neighbor.  Then you must tell those clues to your neighbor.  Then you look at a diagram or get some questions.  This was a lot of fun.  We had a tough time getting a perfect score even with the easy ones.   I liked the game.  It&#039;s very puzzle-like but heavily memory dependent.   

If you do not like puzzle or memory games stay away.  Otherwise it is an excellent family game for kids 8+.  Maybe a little tough on very young kids.  " />
