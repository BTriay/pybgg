						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

The only problem with the cartoonish font is that you may possibly misread a number (as I did in one game). Nicely themed and perfect for logic-puzzle fans...which I&#039;m not, but I loved the game anyways!" />

									<comment username="CharmlessMan77" rating="8.5" value="So much freaking love for this fascinating game.  You are all investigators who have some information that you have gathered and need to pass to your fellow investigators by whispering your information to someone else, hearing other people&#039;s information and passing all that information to someone else... it&#039;s easier in practice.  You then write everything you can remember down and then the questions come out.  The game is only playable by exactly 4 people, and is a co-op.  You can score up to 12 points as a team.  Funny, fun, and really works your little grey cells.  This game was an instabuy shortly after playing my first session of it." />

I love that it&#039;s not straight memorization from the Chinese Whispers portion; once you get the facts you still need to apply some thinkin&#039; to answer the questions correctly. Really, really dig this one." />

									<comment username="Emsdad" rating="8.5" value="Such a novel concept and a great game - think Chinese Whispers combined with a logic puzzle to solve, with a healthy dose of fun thrown in! The only downside is that you do need exactly 4 players to play." />
