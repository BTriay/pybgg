						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

Very simple variation on &quot;Telephone.&quot;  You play the worst detectives ever as you whisper clues down the line and try to remember lots of information, then try to answer a bunch of questions at the end.  Challenging while sober, hilarious while buzzed." />

It&#039;s like spy telephone.  Get all the info from everyone else, piece it together, come to conclusions and answer questions.  I think it&#039;s a hoot.  7.5." />

									<comment username="doyle9904" rating="7.5" value="I bought this on the recommendation of SH&amp;SD, and I was not disappointed. Sure it&#039;s a memory game, but putting the puzzles together at the end is what make it special. And the fact that the listeners cannot prompt the whisperer for any clarification (other than &quot;repeat&quot;), makes for lots of strange/confused/frustrated looks passing between players. Lots of fun." />

The concept of the game is fun, but it&#039;s hard to rate it overall, because the individual scenarios are very hit and miss, and have different skills that are challenged. Some of them felt like way too much was implied and were dissappointed, but others were interesting AF and very rewarding when we put it together. Definitely recommend giving it a try." />

With the right group (i.e. attentive team players with good memories), it&#039;s a blast. With the wrong group, I can imagine it being absolutely miserable. I do wish the game provided a better means of gauging how successful a group of players was. " />
