						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

View of this game is diminishing. I like the central mechanism and theme but not the puzzles themselves...they haven&#039;t seemed &quot;fair&quot; or to be an &quot;honest&quot; challenge." />

									<comment username="sweetsweetdoughnuts" rating="6.5" value="I think this was badly demoed at Essen (and the rulebook doesn&#039;t help). The first scenario and rulebook show basically no game and all the players are doing is playing Chinese Whispers/Broken Telephone (delete as culturally understood). If this is the only scenario that people played, this could easily be rated a 1 as it isn&#039;t a game.

We persevered though and played a more difficult scenario (though not the hardest).

This scenario had much more going on with information changing meaning as time went on and more information was uncovered. The later scenarios seemed quite interesting, but unfortunately by then our collective interest had already waned from the first play.

I suspect this has slightly more replayability than it first appears as there is a lot of information to recall; more than I&#039;m likely to remember across plays, though the easy scenarios are unplayably easy.

I suspect that if I played it again, on a decent difficulty level, that this rating could easily go up quite a long way.

Update: I think I described this as shit but fun after my 5th play. That seems accurate.

Rating up from 5.9 to 6.5." />
