						               													<description>Witness is set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another &amp;mdash; but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Witness includes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

I have to rate this highly mainly due to its originality. It has been a long time since I&#039;ve played a game that felt entirely fresh. I don&#039;t like the cooperative nature of the game, and that has been a barrier to entry for some players in our group, but I enjoy the memory element and the telephone part of the game is a lot of fun. Like Galaxy Trucker, it&#039;s fun to see things go awry." />

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

Witness was an unknown to me. I don’t remember why I bought it (perhaps on a sale) but I’m very glad I did. I like the game a lot.

The rules are uber simple, you can explain them under 1 minute. Playtime is around 10 minutes. Witness is a very basic game, but after reading the rules I still didn’t have a hang of it, which is weird these days. You need to play it to really experience it :D.

The art is very good, it is reminiscent of the old Dick Tracy comics (I don’t know the Blake and Mortimer Comics), but the books came wrinkled and battered in my copy, they were too free inside the box and they got damaged during shipping.

Memory is one of my favorite game mechanism, and here it is paramount. You need to listen and pass the information you have and without having a good memory the score will be low. Witness also have lots of deduction which is another (perhaps my favorite) game mechanism, so it works great for me.

The game comes with 64 missions and that’s a lot, still, I feel the replay value is high because most players won’t remember all the facts within 10 minutes, let alone during months!

Witness only works with 4 players, no more and no less. 

I wish I could buy it in Spanish, as you cannot see all other players´ books, you cannot help them with the language as I usually do.

Bottom line, Witness is a novel, unique and original game. Perhaps it is underrated as I haven’t heard much about it. Since I played it, I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I need to play it again soon, a fascinating game but not for everybody. Play it before you buy it.

Current Rating: 7.5
